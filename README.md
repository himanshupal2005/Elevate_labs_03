SQL Queries Overview:

1. Retrieved all customer records from the customers table to inspect complete customer data.

2. Filtered customers based on creation date to identify customers added after a specific date.

3. Sorted customer records by creation date in descending order to view the most recent customers first.

4. Aggregated customers by month to analyze monthly customer growth using date formatting and grouping.

5. Joined customers and orders tables using a LEFT JOIN to display all customers along with their order details, including customers without any orders.

6. Identified high-value customers whose total purchase amount exceeds the average order value using subqueries and aggregation.

7. Checked for repeat customers by counting the number of orders per customer; confirmed no customer has placed more than one order.

8. Retrieved the most recent order date for each customer, returning NULL for customers with no orders.

9. Calculated total revenue generated from all orders using aggregate functions.

10. Computed the average order value (AOV) to understand overall purchasing behavior.
